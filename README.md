# criptoSGR: Cryptography utility

In symmetric and asymmetric cryptography we need to manage
keys and distribute a message securely to another person.

This utility helps manage some of that.

A simplified approach was attempted and also the flexibility to
use any program with the inputs and outputs from this script. This
is why no files with specific formatting and parsing are created here.
The user is instead notified of what was done and any outputs generated
so he/she can send emails with the right data, or by any other
distribution means.

Notice also that because of the simplicity, there are no settings to
set default file name and extensions for example, because that's a
change the user can easily make with the resulting files.

## More information

This utility was made for a class in Network Security and Management
(Segurança e Gestão de Redes).

The problem set is `docs`, but in portuguese.
